## Single and simple page, oriented to the type of personal portfolio 💼

#

### I made this simple page as a challenge for module number 3 of the [Apx school](https://apx.school/) fullstack web development career. I loved having experimented with CSS and it helped me reinforce basic knowledge of CSS and responsive design but without using BEM methodology.

#

### Technologies used in the project: _HTML5_, _CSS_, _Git_ and _Github Pages_ for deployment.
